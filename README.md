# Parsec Base Build
The base build provides a parent build.gradle file for any Parsec project to inherit from. The build file includes
dependencies, build plugins, and necessary configurations that are used within a Parsec project. These external settings
are designed to enforce a standardized build process in which enhances the quality of the Parsec client's application.
